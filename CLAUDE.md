# Conversion to Crystal

Your task is to convert this project to the crystal programming language, a compiled language that resembles Ruby. It features a robust, comprehensive datetime library in its stdlib that can fully replace TZInfo. You should be able to therefore build a version with no external dependencies other that stdlib.


Requirements

1. 100% conversion of code
2. 100% conversion of tests 
3. No feature/functionality should be added or removed. Everything should stay the same
4. All tests MUST be passing at 100% pass rate. Absolutely no failures and no new skips
5. Provide README on how to compile
